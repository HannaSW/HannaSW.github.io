# About me

In 2023, I obtained my PhD in Mathematics advised by [Prof. Josef Teichmann](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jteichma/) in the [Stochastic Finance Group](https://math.ethz.ch/imsf/sf.html) of ETH Zurich, affiliated with [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/). During my PhD, I was working on the mathematical theory of deep learning algorithms and their applications to Mathematical Finance.

Prior to that, I received a B.Sc. (2015) and a M.Sc. (2018) in Applied Mathematics from the [Technical University of Vienna](https://www.tuwien.at/en/) (specializing in Financial and Actuarial Mathematics). Additionally, I received a M.Sc. (2018) in Quantitative Finance from the [Vienna University of Economics and Business](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/).
